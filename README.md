This UK Food Standard Agency involves evaluating various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. I was contracted by the editors of a magazine called Eat Safe, Love to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. In this assignment, I was able to create two Juypyter Notebooks for setup and analysis.

The first Juypyter Notebook is called NoSQL_setup_starter_solution.ipynb. In this notebook, I created a database called uk_food and a collection called establishments through the mac terminal in order to import the required data. Also, this required to libraries called PyMongo and Pretty Print. I created a instance of the Mongo Client and confirmed that the database loaded the data properly in MongoDB. I assigned the establishments collection to a variable for use.
